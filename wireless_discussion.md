# FreeBSD Wireless Monthly Discussions

## Discussion #1 - Tuesday, December 3, 2024 at 20:00 UTC

### Attendees

- [X] Tom Jones

### Noteworthy Items

- Adrian created [a wiki page for net80211 ALQ logging](https://wiki.freebsd.org/WiFi/AlqLogging).

- Li-Wen shared information about Alvin Chen's Dell ThinOS group after the meeting.

    Alvin's team has directly ported WiFi6 for Intel and Realtek chips
    from Linux.  Their stack may have large differences from ours, but they are
    willing to discuss integration with us.  They are interested in knowing plans
    for the net80211 API and to see how they can collaborate with us.

    Bjoern is curious how they ported the entire GPL stack (clean room) to a BSD
    license and how they plan to update it.

    Li-Wen is trying to determine this.  Alvin is also putting in effort to
    convince people within the company to work with us.  Ideally they could have
    an NDA with the Foundation and share a private repository with those who
    sign the NDA.  That way, we could inspect their code and cherry-pick useful
    parts.  As is typical in these situations, they also don't want to diverge
    too far from the vanilla FreeBSD kernel.  From Li-Wen's past calls with
    them, they are comfortable upgrading FreeBSD versions every two years,
    aligning with our .0 releases.  However, porting and updating both the Linux
    layer and the FreeBSD ABI/KBI is too challenging.

- Alice:
https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop Ed suggested that I could attend this call as there was a wish for some input on how to collate and organise work going forward. I've been doing something similar with the cloud native (OCI) group and can potentially show that on the call by way of example. Otherwise, as this is a technical call I wouldn't expect to be a regular attendee.

### Topic for Discussion: Porting Linux wireless drivers to native FreeBSD drivers.

Bjoern says,

> Another interesting -- possibly research only -- item would be how hard would
> it be to directly take the Linux drivers and port them natively (without other
> BSDs and mangling involded).

> And by that I may not mean the entire 802.11 stack work but maybe the data
> path (skb vs. mbuf) -- an abstraction we have come to in the wired world.  As
> that may be something we could ask vendors to split off possibly (especially
> if we were to do the work)?

> So take what is in sys/contrib/dev/ and "mbuf-tize" it in a way that it could
> be "unifdefed" or similar for the skbuff world?  I do not think yet that it
> may be possible to completely have a driver "common" and an OS-part easily --
> though I know some original vendor drivers not as-in Linux have some
> abstractions for that (or had in the past).

> Given we have three people porting Linux drivers to FreeBSD in different ways
> it would be interesting to compare notes on this.

### Comments and Updates

- Adrian
    - Status of self-assigned ToDos?
    - Slow progress on #1
    - It would be really good getting eyballs on the issue where kernel panics
      from X are not viewable.
    - Ed: This used to work, but it's a regression in a drm update.  We've had
      Mitchell Horne tring to get hrs's USB debug into the tree which would
      allow us to debug the crash and also use it to debug the debugger.  It's a
      valid, but tricky situation to resolve.
    - Tom: Mitchell says it didn't work.
    - Ed: On specific hardware it does.  If we can find some model to demo that
      it works on Windows or Linux and use it to debug the VT switching issue,
      that would be good.
    - Tom: I stared setting this up last week.
    - Adrian: I would also like to have kernel crashing during VT switching.
    - bz: I know it works on my laptop b/c I tried hrs's patch before.
    - Tom: I would like it if we could get suspend/resume in quemu.  Right now
      it doesn't work very well.
    - bz: TODO: I can try it out in the next days.
    - Ed: If we can at least have it in the tree and if bz has hardware that's
      known to work.... It's been a long time where it's been in an uncertain
      state.

    - Mediatek driver for the mt7601 USB landed a few weeks ago.  fwget was the last
      roadblock.

    - I will be working on the sequence handling next to help unblock Bjoern.

- Bjoern
    - Plan for old wireless PRs?  Mark Linimon has started to clean them up.  Adrian
      picked some up as well.  The meta-pr is helpful to get the bigger picture.

    - More discussion about porting Linux drivers to native drivers?  Trying to
      change the datapath is somsething we didn't try.  It would be interesting
      to see if someone could do a project to investigate.

      Adrian: I wrote a shim layer.. you can write an intermediary layer.  The
      Linux devs don't want to add accessor methods becasuse it was viewed as
      extranious overhead.  Turing skbs in and out of mbufs is really hard.
      There are enough weird semantic diffs....???
    - Updates on jsm's mt7601 11n usb driver, in review?

    - Roaming question?  I've been using my own code.. it won't roam.

      Adrian: There are a bunch of different paths to make it work. You have to
      do a background scan.  A lot of plumbing has to be done.  I got that all
      mostly working a while ago.  The second part: supplicant has to do
      preauth.  Depending on which way you do roaming...???

      I don't think it's too hard to do dumb roaming....

      Adrian TODO: Create a wiki page for roaming (Created a skeleton page
      during the meeting.)

    - WTAP question?

      bz: Can I just go through these reviews and close them.

      Li-Wen: Student wanted to return for a Canadian working holiday, but he
      can't because of changes to Canadian immigration.  He'll stay with his job
      at Canonical.

      bz: Do you mind if I do that work.

      Li-Wen: If you have time, that would be great.

    - Development progress?

- Tom
    - My iwx work is almost ready for review.
    - Not getting same rates as Adrian.
    TODO: Adrian to send list of devices to Tom.

- Li-Wen
    - Talking to Mediatek friend to see if we can get datasheet of MT7922
      (wifi6) and MT7925 (wifi7) used in Framework Laptop/Desktop AMD models.

    PR about TXQ problems before the next release ships with it
  - TODO: give iwx a try

- Cy

    - Fixed WAP_Supplicant for 13/14.

- Tom
    - iwx is in review: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49259

- Alvin

- Li-Wen
    - Mediatek team responsible for MT79xx refused our request of accessing the datasheet because their resource is only for the important customers.
        - Trying to ask help from their customers, AMD (via Framework)
    - Realtek is also still WIP, but mainly for wired NIC (5G NIC is used in Framework Desktop)
        - are we interested (and have time) on Realtek's wireless product?
    - Testing AX210 with iwlwifi(4) in -CURRENT on my Framework (intel 13th gen) and Sheng-Yi (aokblast@)'s intel Ultra 1 during 202503 Tokyo hackathon
        - the same chip AX210
        - mine Cannot assoc to 5GHz ap, got ng/na at best
        - Sheng-Yi can assoc to 5GHz ap, but only once after boot
        - some error/crash in firmware
        - will analysis more and provide useful information later

### Action Items

- Bjoern (will backup from others) will start communication the KBI plan through
  15/16.  We need to keep Adrian in the loop.

- Tom, as part of his Wi-Fi documentation efforts, to look at adding Wi-Fi
  content to the Handbook.

### Comments and Updates

- Bjoern

    Most of my updates are the wireless mailing list.  Basically for 14.3, I've
    merged everything I can now.  I had to merge three changes from Adrian.
    That's one of the open things for this meeting, i.e.. to see how we deal
    with that because Adrian doesn't MFC, and after a year or so you get stuck
    on changes.

    Other that that, it's moving things along for me trying to fix anything that
    comes up with iwlwifi and dealing with technical debt in net802.11 like race
    conditions and lock.  A bunch of PRs can in last night and I try to deal
    with them as soon as possible to keep things moving forward.  iwlwifi also
    needs PCI changes, which I need to do for LinuxKPI, then I can work on
    MediaTek.

    The other big topic is how to deal with 15 and 16. We'll likely change
    things in incompatible ways and I'd like to have a strategy for 15 and 16.
    Otherwise people will be stuck with what we have now for a really long time.

    Tom: What about the expected breaking changes for 15.0?n

    Bjoern: If we do the channel and method cleanups and locking changes it will
    affect all the drivers.  Tom: So we'll basically be stuck with 14.3
    performance and standards in the 15 branch and 16 will get all this stuff?

    Bjoern: I don't know.  This is my question.  Unless we say 15 WiFi is just
    not going to be stable with respect to WiFi.  If you look like what Sam did
    15-20 years ago, it was massive changes and they basically broke everything
    and then in half a year, the next big block of changes came in.  I can't
    deal with more stuff in LinuxKPI now.  I need to start fixing that 802.11
    and getting things into there.  If you want to add 11ac you have to extend
    the structures and other stuff, which is mostly fine I guess, but KPIs will
    change that will affect drivers.  I don't know the solution and I don't know
    what people think about it because if we can declare 15 as unstable then at
    least 15 and 16 can move forward, and 14 would be kind of at the point where
    it is now plus minor bug fixes improvements that we can do. But keeping
    completely at this level is, I think, way too long, because that's gonna be
    another two and a half years before 16.

    Tom: But we do have A/C now in 15.  We do have drivers now, which will do
    almost a gigabit of traffic.  The only things we need are WPA3 and
    everything to support it.  That's the solution to the "this network doesn't
    work at all with FreeBSD" problem.

    Bjoern: How so?

    Tom: We've had reports that people have had to downgrade the security of
    their AP to use FreeBSD WiFi because we don't have WPA3.  But that's the
    only thing I've heard of where there is a hard break where things just don't
    work at all.  People aren't really complaining about it yet.

    Bjoern: We, as the WiFi group have to make a decision at some point.

    Tom: I think we would probably want bigger buy in from Freebsd developers,
    at least because we're going to get all of the fallout right if we say that
    Wi-fi and 15 is not going to be binary compatible.  So there will be
    breakages.  People might just make jokes and say, Well, Wi-Fi, being
    unstable is better than they're not being Wi-Fi like, I don't know how great
    a response we get from anyone, but at least there would be progress right,
    then, no one could say, we're not making things.  We're not working on
    it. If we're breaking it, we're definitely working on it.

    Bjoern: And we will definitely break things, because all the old drivers, if
    you go and look, that's the next question gonna be, how many of them are we
    gonna carry forward because we still have abg drivers, you know, don't even
    do anything. And I understand why we still have them.  The question is, for
    how long are we gonna still have them?  And who can test them?  Because
    testing 40 different devices, I can tell you, is going to take an awful lot
    of time, and we need to have our users do that or eventually say, okay, it's
    broken. We'll fix it if someone comes up and says, hey, it's broken. I still
    have a device running or something, or they come up because even between 3
    of us or 4 of us, we can't do that.  I can't see us doing it. Let's put it
    that way.

    Tom: Yeah, I agree.  It's difficult to get the diversity of hardware in a
    way you can test it as well. But we could do a best effort.

    Bjoern: What I've done for rtw88/89 is, I've loaded the driver I configured
    Wi-Fi to make sure it can pass packets. I made sure, multicast works,
    broadcast works...

    Tom Jones: We probably need to ask Adrian. Adrian might say that breaking
    things is fine.

    Bjoern: And the next question is, do we actually have out of tree Wi-Fi
    drivers, apart from the one that Adrian started 10 years ago.

    Ed: And do we care?  We already don't have a stable KBI in point releases.
    We pretend we do, but we haven't for year.  My view is that we have to be
    transparent about what we're doing.  I can't imagine anyone is going to say
    they would rather have a fixed, broken KBI than working Wi-Fi throughout the
    course of the 15.

    Bjoern: I agree with you and I would love to keep the momentum going and
    move forward.

    Ed: Oh, I'm sure someone is going to say I have a 15 year old whatever-card
    that I rely on, but I'm gonna buy a small collection of the the $15 TP-Link
    USB dongles, and just, I'll mail one to everyone who complains about all
    hardware, not working. :)

    Joe: A dongle for you, and a dongle for you, and a dongle for everyone!

    Bjoern: Yeah, okay. So in theory, we should communicate this, we should just
    go ahead and do this.

    Ed: I think so.

    Tom: Yeah, yeah, I think we we communicate it.

- Tom

    Tom: I had to check when we last met and so, since we last met, I landed
    iwx, which I did right at the start of April.

    There was some fallout around the build which I fixed, and I think from that
    I learned that I wasn't getting any build failures from anything.  So that
    was that was nice.  It means I haven't broken the build for a long time.
    Also I broke the build, and I didn't know about it, and nobody told me.

    I spent a lot of time writing a series of introductory articles on how to do
    Wi-Fi development.

    I'll be writing debugging stuff as I try and debug some of the outstanding
    stuff with iwx like it not always associating very well.  I just need to do
    more testing. And it's quite opaque what's going on.  I've also not looked
    at it for a while for because I've been doing other things.

    I think, going into May. I'm gonna get some semi automated regressions
    together with the machines I have, so that we have more confidence about
    drive by commits from people.  What we would be able to do is get somebody
    with a Wi-Fi change to run a script for us and self report.

    Bjoern: Are you going to look at the Handbook as well?

    Tom: I can, what what needs to be in the Handbook?

    Bjoern: How to use Wi-Fi.

    Tom: Yeah, I can look at a handbook. I'll add it to my todo list.

    Tom: A bigger thing for me is making Wi-Fi testable from Lua, so that we
    have all the bindings in place and we can ask for tests in Lua rather than
    shell scripts which are going to fall apart.

- Cy

    Someone submmited a pull request for WPA supplicant.

- Li-Wen

    Thanks Bjoern for updating the regdomain.  Things working great now in TW.
    I can help the script and contact the regdb maintainer.

    Still working on doc sending to AMD, including ask them to ask Mediatek to
    share info with FreeBSD.

    Any thoughts for setting up a wireless lab (for ci?) in Kitchener? Can
    initialize it in hackathon after BSDCan.

    Can check if my friend at Ubiquiti can stil help for some hardware (not sure
    if it's useful).

    enweiwu@ will be in BSDCan (for 2 days) and Hackathon (for 4 days).  wtap(4)
    rebase and merge is one of the goals.

### Action Items

#### Overview

We discussed stable KBIs and breaking changes across versions 15 and 16, with
consensus reached on implementing necessary changes without seeking user
permission.  Wi-Fi support and driver development were discussed, including
discussions about hardware compatibility, testing environments, and various
driver improvements.

- Tom

    Got suspend and review working on iwx and that's in the tree.  It works
    really well and it doesn't crash.  I sometimes have to bring the interface
    up and down multiple times to get it to work.  Sometimes I can force a bunch
    of UPD through it and it works.  Adrian suggested this might be a WPA issue.
    Other than that, I think the iwx import work is done.  There are a few minor
    issues, then we can start working on 160 MHz channels.

- Adrian

    I started testing iwx and iwlwfifi again.  Hopefully I'll give feedback this
    week.  They both don't panic the kernel frequently, which is nice.  I've
    been doing general Wi-Fi stack cleanup.  I'm going to get back up to
    cleaning up trasmit locking stuff.  I'm trying to encourage anyone
    interested to build that community up again.  I've been working on older
    qualcom atheros Wi-Fi stuff.  I've started working on the Qualcom Snapdragon
    laptop.  That's important because a bunch of the later Qualcom Wi-Fi AP
    chips started sharing code with the Snapsrap laptops.  Hopefully over the
    next few months as I bring up more of the AP support we'll have another
    vehicle for testing Wi-Fi AP testing.  I'm going to do a post about that.
    Bjoern: Which Wi-Fi generation do you have now?

    adrian: I have all of it.  I got the Dakota, which is Wi-Fi 5 and I have one
    of each chip after that.  The problem as you go further up, it starts
    looking more like a cell phone chipset, which means I have a lot of drivers
    to bring up before I can even turn on the ath11 knf 12k chipset, which I
    don't mind doing, but it dovetails quickly.

    bjoern: I'm asking because I still have an old phone around and I do have ???
    APs that I'm using, so I can help test.

    Adrian: Ok. Thanks.  I also did buy the first-gen Wi-Fi 5 ath10k AP chipset.
    I bought a couple of PCI cards and my ath10k driver does do cascade, 4x4,
    160 Mhz, and it does multi-user ?? mode.  I should really Finnish my ath10k
    port.  I should finish my ath10k port, and I could probably build 160 mhz
    4x4 AP today if I debugged that driver before.

    tom: That would be nice.  I cannot get openwrt to do this.

    adrian: It's a pain because as soon as you start speaking at 160 mhz, you
    have to be absolutely certain that you choose a channel set that does not
    overlap with DFS.

    tom: I've got a lab.  The configuration that openwrt generates for hostapd
    only does 80 mhz channel.  If I change anything it gives me a completely
    broken AP.  We need a test target for 160.

    adrian: I bought a 160 mhz dlink ap for testing.  Nothing done with it yet.

    tom: I think my arrows?? should, but they don't.

    adrian: arrows won't do 80 because they want more channels to do more mesh
    with and 160 channels take up all the bandwidth and a higher noise ??

    bz: ??

    adrian: Finding a chipset that does 80/80 is difficult.

    bz: I know wrt is able to do it.

    tom: If it's HE80, it should do Vht160?

    adrian: No.  It's the other way around.  If you're doing vht160 that implies the rest down the line.

    tom: HE, not NT.  It's configured to do HE80.  If I change that, I don't get a working AP.

    adrian: It may not let you do that. Send me the details.  I'll look at the
    config.

    ardian: I spent time trying to figure out how to build a flashable image for
    my dlink AP.  The way that you have to it is to create multi-layer uboot
    images where you take a uboot image and embed it inside a uboot image.....
    It gets unpacked as you flash into the right partition.  It was an absolute
    nightmare, but I know have all the basic pieces to flash a Qualcom platform.

    adrian: GCMP hasn't land.  bz have you been able to test it.

    bz: Yes, I did.

    Let's start with GCMP.  The hardest part is getting FreeeBSD ?? ap working.
    I have to recycle the interfaces??  It's something we should look into.
    I've got GCMP working
